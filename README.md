## Making a Set game and algorithm for playing in Python

cardClass.py contains the class Card, as well as conversions between the features of the cards and their corresponding numerical value
gameClass.py contains the actual game. the list of cards is stored in the class Game. there are functions for adding, removing, getting, and organizing cards.
the class Game also contains the function findMatch, which will search for a match. findMatch returns a tuple of three card objects if it finds a match, returns None if no match is found

as of when this README has been written, main.py and the graphics programs are still being developed
